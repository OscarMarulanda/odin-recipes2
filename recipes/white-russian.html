    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a cocktail that I first heard of in a movie, <em>The Great Lebowski</em>. It is a movie about a guy who gets mixed up in dangerous business because he has the same name as another man.</p>
    <p>This cocktail caught my attention, and I suppose everybody who saw the movie's attention, because the main character keeps ordering it over and over, everywhere he goes.</p>
    <p>He is a pretty chill dude. This is actually what he likes to be called, <strong>the dude.</strong> Anyway...</p>
    <h4>For this cocktail you'll need to following:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces vodka</li>
        <li>1 ounce Kahlúa</li>
        <li>1 splash heavy cream</li>
        <li>Love</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the vodka and Kahlúa to a rocks glass filled with ice.</li>
        <li>Top with the heavy cream and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Drink with love and have a great time.</p>
