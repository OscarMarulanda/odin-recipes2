    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite sandwich. I usually eat it at least once a month. I get it at subway, but now that I'm a freelancing english teacher finding my own students, I'll try and learn to make it myself.</p>
    <p>I guess the most difficult part will be getting the right bread. Maybe I can fashion my own bread with a regular baguette, some garlic and oregano, and a little butter.</p>
    <h3>These are the ingredients you'll need to make me a sandwich:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a baguette</li>
        <li>some slices of cheese</li>
        <li>some sliced bell peppers</li>
        <li>a sliced tomato</li>
        <li>one single slice of a jalape√±o</li>
        <li>chopped lettuce</li>
        <li>sliced pickles</li>
        <li>half a chicken breast, diced</li>
        <li>teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>chipotle sauce</li>
        <li>sweet onion sauce</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>an onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>These is how you make this delicious sandwich:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>slice the bread open</li>
        <li>put some chicken and cheese inside the bread</li>
        <li>put bread, chicken, and cheese inside the oven for 1 minute, just enough to get it toasty</li>
        <li>take sandwich out of the oven and add vegetables. Be careful not to add too much of any of the vegetables as this won't leave enough room for the others.</li>
        <li>add sauces to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your sandwich is ready! you can pair it with a cold glass of mango or passion fruit juice and a cookie :)</p>
