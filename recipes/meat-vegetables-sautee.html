    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite dishes. I usually eat it with my girlfriend. We make it together; It is a great recipe because it is relatively simple to make and I think it is healthy - it has lots of protein and vegetables, and you can pair it with rice to get some carbs, too.</p>
    <p>When I make this dish with my girlfriend, I chop up the vegetables and she is in charge of sauteing everything and adding the sauces. I hope you have someone to make this dish with, too :3</p>
    <h3>These are the ingredients you'll need to make me a sandwich:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>half a pound of beef, chopped</li>
        <li>some sliced bell peppers</li>
        <li>one tomato, diced, unpeeled</li>
        <li>chopped lettuce</li>
        <li>teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>an onion, sliced</li>
        <li>a sliced cucumber</li>
        <li>a little cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>These is how you make this delicious dish:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First you need to fry the meat a little so it is tender when you add the rest</li>
        <li>When the meat is soft and a little cooked, add the vegetables</li>
        <li>mix everything together and stir until it's all juicy</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your sauté is ready! you can pair it with rice or mashed potatoes and a cold glass of mango or passion fruit juice and a cookie :)</p>
